# Final Remarks 

This report is a documentation of our collective efforts to prepare the ANN project at eLifeSprint 2020. We hope that the efforts we collectively made during the sprint will allow the project to start its journey until becoming a reality. 

The project is going to be continuously improved at [github.com/lubianat/ann](github.com/lubianat/ann), where future tasks have been organized as issues. Everyone is welcome to join us and help empowering open biomedical knowledge with collaborative semantic enrichment.
